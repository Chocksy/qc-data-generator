# Fast Options Generator - Enhancement Tasks

This document outlines comprehensive improvements to make our fast options generator more realistic and complete compared to the LEAN RandomDataGenerator.

## Phase 1: Critical Data Correlation & Realism Issues ðŸš¨

### P1.1: Underlying Price Continuity & Synchronization
**Priority: CRITICAL** - These issues could cause unrealistic backtesting results

- [ ] **Fix price gaps between trading days**: Currently each day starts from base_price, causing unrealistic jumps
- [ ] **Implement realistic weekend/holiday gap handling**: Add proper gap distributions for non-trading periods  
- [ ] **Add intraday mean reversion**: Prevent excessive price drift within a single trading day
- [ ] **Ensure option prices properly track underlying movements**: Validate Black-Scholes inputs update correctly
- [ ] **Fix time-to-expiration calculations**: Account for intraday theta decay and business days only
- [ ] **Implement proper business day calculations**: Handle weekends, holidays, half-days

### P1.2: Option-Underlying Price Correlation
**Priority: CRITICAL** - Core to realistic option behavior

- [ ] **Validate underlying price feeds to option pricing**: Ensure same underlying price used across all options
- [ ] **Fix volatility consistency**: Ensure volatility estimates reflect actual underlying price movements
- [ ] **Implement Greeks consistency**: Validate delta, gamma behavior matches underlying moves
- [ ] **Add price arbitrage checks**: Detect and prevent unrealistic option pricing scenarios

### P1.3: Universe File Accuracy & Option Chain Management
**Priority: HIGH** - Affects strategy availability and realism

- [ ] **Validate option chains properly represent available contracts**: Check strike spacing and availability
- [ ] **Ensure strike prices are realistic for underlying price levels**: Use proper rounding based on price
- [ ] **Fix expiration date generation**: Ensure proper weekly/monthly/daily expiration schedules
- [ ] **Add strike filtering based on liquidity**: Remove strikes that would be illiquid (deep ITM/OTM)

## Phase 2: Advanced Pricing Models & Market Microstructure

### P2.1: Dynamic Volatility Models
**Priority: HIGH** - Static volatility is unrealistic

- [ ] **Replace static volatility with volatility surface**: Vary by strike and time to expiration
- [ ] **Add volatility smile/skew effects**: Higher IV for OTM puts, smile for equity options
- [ ] **Implement time-varying volatility**: Volatility that changes over time and correlates with price moves
- [ ] **Add implied volatility clustering**: Periods of high/low volatility
- [ ] **Implement volatility term structure**: Different IV for different expirations

### P2.2: Market Microstructure Realism
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Improves execution realism

- [ ] **Implement realistic bid-ask spreads**: Based on option liquidity, moneyness, time to expiration
- [ ] **Add proper volume patterns by moneyness**: Higher volume for ATM options
- [ ] **Fix open interest calculations**: More realistic OI based on actual option trading patterns
- [ ] **Add liquidity modeling**: Some options should have low/no volume on certain days
- [ ] **Implement time-of-day effects**: Different behavior near open/close, lunch hour

## Phase 3: Missing LEAN RandomDataGenerator Features

### P3.1: Data Density Control
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Currently always generates dense data

- [ ] **Implement Dense/Sparse/VerySparse modes**: Control tick frequency
- [ ] **Add configurable tick frequency**: Not every minute for illiquid options
- [ ] **Add data density based on option characteristics**: ATM options more dense than OTM
- [ ] **Implement realistic "no trading" periods**: Some options don't trade every minute

### P3.2: Corporate Actions Support
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Missing completely from current implementation

- [ ] **Add basic stock splits generation**: 2:1, 3:2 splits with proper option adjustments
- [ ] **Implement dividend payments**: Regular quarterly dividends affecting option pricing
- [ ] **Add stock renames/symbol changes**: Handle ticker symbol changes over time
- [ ] **Implement IPO simulation**: New stocks entering the market
- [ ] **Add spin-off events**: Corporate restructuring events

### P3.3: Advanced Configuration & Market Integration
**Priority: LOW** - Nice to have features

- [ ] **Add quote/trade ratio control**: Configure relative frequency of quotes vs trades
- [ ] **Integrate market hours database**: Handle early close days, holidays, extended hours
- [ ] **Implement advanced strike rounding logic**: Price-dependent strike increments ($0.50, $1, $2.50, $5)
- [ ] **Add multiple underlying support**: Generate options for multiple stocks simultaneously
- [ ] **Implement realistic expiration cycles**: Monthly, weekly, quarterly options

## Phase 4: Validation, Testing & Output Enhancement

### P4.1: Data Validation Suite
**Priority: HIGH** - Essential for production use

- [ ] **Check for arbitrage opportunities**: Call-put parity, calendar spread arbitrage
- [ ] **Validate price relationships**: Calls > puts for same strike when stock > strike
- [ ] **Add statistical realism tests**: Price movements follow reasonable distributions
- [ ] **Implement Greeks validation**: Ensure Greeks behave as expected
- [ ] **Add benchmark comparison**: Compare generated data patterns with real market data

### P4.2: Greeks Calculation & Advanced Output
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Useful for advanced strategies

- [ ] **Calculate and output Greeks**: Delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho for each option
- [ ] **Implement Greeks-based validation**: Use Greeks to validate option price consistency
- [ ] **Add portfolio-level risk metrics**: For multi-leg strategies
- [ ] **Output volatility surface data**: Implied volatility by strike/expiration
- [ ] **Add performance analytics**: Track hit rates, PnL attribution

## Phase 5: Performance & Scalability
**Priority: LOW** - Current performance is already excellent

- [ ] **Optimize memory usage for large datasets**: Handle year+ of data generation
- [ ] **Add resumption capability enhancement**: Better checkpoint/restart functionality
- [ ] **Implement distributed generation**: Multi-machine scaling for very large datasets
- [ ] **Add streaming output**: Generate and immediately stream to target directory

## Implementation Priority

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Critical data correlation issues that affect backtesting accuracy
2. **Phase 2** - Advanced pricing models for realism  
3. **Phase 3** - Missing LEAN features for completeness
4. **Phase 4** - Validation and testing
5. **Phase 5** - Performance optimizations

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Generated option data passes arbitrage checks
- [ ] Options properly track underlying price movements
- [ ] Backtesting results are realistic and actionable
- [ ] Data quality matches or exceeds LEAN RandomDataGenerator
- [ ] Performance remains 20x+ faster than original LEAN implementation
